## Concept
Create categories for Habits/Hobbies - and Create cards for the behaviors you want to track. 
Choose goals for each behavior, and log your time invested as you go.
Get rewarded with Experience Points, and level up to mastery. 

## Resources & Frameworks
1. UI & Front-End: React.js
2. State Management: Redux
3. Current REST API: JSON Server
4. Planned REST API: Node Express & Mongoose/Mongo DB

*I am currently developing the backend funtionality using Node, Express, and MongoDb. JSON server is being utilized for interim testing.*
